//A linear collection of data elements. Each element points to the next one. Each node(element) is composed of data and a reference(link) to the next node.
//Time complexity: Access : O(n); Search : O(n) Insertion : O(1) Deletion : O(n);
//Advantage : add and remove way faster than at array
//Disadvantage: no direct access(has only sequential access) like array has.
